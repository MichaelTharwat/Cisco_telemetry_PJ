# Streaming Telemetry For CISCO IOS-XR devices (ASR9k - NCS)

Model-Driven Telemetry is a new approach for network monitoring in which data is streamed from network devices continuously using a push model and provides near real-time access to operational statistics. Applications can subscribe to specific data items they need, by using standard-based YANG data models over NETCONF-YANG.

### Telemetry Solution

We have configured telegraf to collect cpu and memory utilization besides that we get some interfaces statistics also QOS statistics from cisco routers ASR9k with SW IOS-XR, then logging these metrices in TSDB (influxdb) and our analysis and dashboards was built on Grafana.
